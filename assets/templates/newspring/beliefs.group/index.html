					<h3>God</h3>
					<p>God is the Creator and Ruler of the universe. He has eternally existed in three persons: the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. These three are co-equal parts of one God.</p>
					<p><small>Genesis 1:1,26,27, 3:22, Psalm 90:2, Matthew 28:19, I Peter 1:2, II Corinthians 13:14</small></p>
				</div>

			<div class="grid__item one-half handheld-one-whole">
				<h3>Jesus</h3>
				<p>Jesus Christ is the Son of God. He is co-equal with the Father. Jesus lived a sinless human life and offered Himself as the perfect sacrifice for the sins of all men by dying on a cross. He arose from the dead after three days to demonstrate His power over sin and death. He ascended to heaven and will return again to reign as King of Kings and Lord of Lords.</p>
				<p><small>Matthew 1:22-23, Isaiah 9:6, John 1:1-5, 14:10-30, Hebrews 4:14-15, I Corinthians 15:3-4, Romans 1:3-4, Acts 1:9-11, I Timothy 6:14-15, Titus 2:13</small></p>
			</div><div class="grid__item one-half handheld-one-whole">
				<h3>The Holy Spirit</h3>
				<p>The Holy Spirit is equal with the Father and the Son as God. He is present in the world to make men aware of their need for Jesus Christ. He also lives in every believer from the moment of salvation. He provides the Christian with power for living, understanding of spiritual truth and guidance in doing what is right. The Christian seeks to live under His control daily.</p>
				<p><small>II Corinthians 3:17, John 16:7-13, 14:16-17, Acts 1:8, I Corinthians 2:12, 3:16, Ephesians 1:13, Galatians 5:25, Ephesians 5:18</small></p>
			</div><div class="grid__item one-third handheld-one-whole">
				<h3>The Bible</h3>
				<p>The Bible is God's Word to all men. It was written by human authors under the supernatural guidance of the Holy Spirit. It is the ultimate source of truth for Christian beliefs and living.</p>

			</div><div class="grid__item one-third handheld-one-whole">
				<h3>Man</h3>
				<p>Man is made in the image of God as the supreme object of God's creation. God designed man to have fellowship with him, but man became alienated from God through disobedience. We are all born with a sinful nature and choose to sin against God. We're incapable of regaining a right relationship with God through our own efforts.</p>
				<p><small>Genesis 1:27, Psalm 8:3-6, Isaiah 53:6, Romans 3:23, Colossians 1:21, Isaiah 59:1-2</small></p>
			</div><div class="grid__item one-third handheld-one-whole">
				<h3>Eternity</h3>
				<p>You were created to exist forever. We believe that forever is spent in one of two places: eternally separated from God because of sin or in union with God because of His forgiveness and salvation. When you die, you will either spend eternity in heaven or hell. Eternal separation from God happens in hell. Eternal union with God occurs in heaven.</p>
				<p><small>John 3:16, I John 2:25, 5:11-13, Romans 6:23, Revelation 20:15</small></p>
			</div><div class="grid__item one-half handheld-one-whole">
				<h3>Salvation</h3>
				<p>Salvation is God's gift to you if you'll accept it. We can never make up for our sin with self-improvement or good works. It is only by trusting in Jesus Christ as God's offer of forgiveness that you can be saved from sin's penalty. Eternal life begins the moment you receive Jesus Christ into your life by faith.</p>

			</div><div class="grid__item one-half handheld-one-whole">
				<h3>Eternal Security</h3>
				<p>Because God gives man eternal life through Jesus Christ, the believer is secure in that salvation for eternity. Salvation is maintained by the grace and power of God, not by the self-effort of the Christian. It is the grace and eternal power of God that gives this security.</p>
				<p><small>John 10:29, II Timothy 1:12, Hebrews 7:25, 10:10-14, I Peter 1:3-5</small></p>
