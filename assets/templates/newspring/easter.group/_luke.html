				<h1 class="alpha">A New Adventure</h1>

				<p>Luke doesn&rsquo;t have to go far to find an adventure.</p>

				<p>Just across the street, at the back of some undeveloped lots in his subdivision, there&rsquo;s a thick stand of trees. Every other day, the 11-year-old will go exploring. One time, he discovered a rusty sickle. Another time, an old gear. He knows there&rsquo;s probably lots of stuff out there that could make the perfect stick weapon.</p>

				<p>Luke&rsquo;s two favorite things? That&rsquo;s easy, he says: isolation and finding stuff. He was only 7 when his dad died. And in the years since, he has to admit it&rsquo;s been pressuring for him, he says. His memories are fading. Not having a dad is the only life he&rsquo;s really known. When he&rsquo;s feeling sad, when he wants some downtime, he prefers to seclude himself in his bedroom or the woods to try and forget about it.</p>

				<p>Luke misses his dad. But he says he wouldn&rsquo;t choose to have his dad with him if it meant thousands of people wouldn&rsquo;t have heard about Jesus and wouldn&rsquo;t have had a chance to go to Heaven. But when friends talk about doing things with their dads, he says, that&rsquo;s what breaks him. Luke knows it would be good to have a father to love and care about him. And right now, that's God&rsquo;s job. He&rsquo;s doing his best to remember that.</p>

					<li><strong class="bigquote">&ldquo;</strong>If I could be any animal, it would be a monkey because they are versatile with their little fingers. My follow-up animal would be a majestic eagle.</li>
					<li><strong class="bigquote">&ldquo;</strong>I have sustained six concussions.</li>
					<li><strong class="bigquote">&ldquo;</strong>Iâ€™m a nerd. You can just tell. I like <em>Doctor Who</em>, <em>Star Wars</em>, <em>Halo</em> and just anything nerdy.</li>
					<li><strong class="bigquote">&ldquo;</strong>I resemble many people in my family. My eyes and ears are a lot like my dad. All together I just look like my grandfather and I look exactly like my cousin. It&rsquo;s kind of freaky.</li>
					<li><strong class="bigquote">&ldquo;</strong>If I could only eat one food for the rest of my life it would be quesadillas from Taco Bell. I would say hot dogs, but those wouldn&rsquo;t sit well every day.</li>
