				<li>“Publicly Perform” means to perform public recitations of the Work and to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public by any means or process and the communication to the public of the performances of the Work, including by public digital performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs, sounds or images.</li>

					The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised.  All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved, including but not limited to the rights set forth in Sections 4(d) and 4(e). 
				</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Restrictions.</strong> The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions: 
			<ol>
				<li>You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform 	the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must include a copy of this 	License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, 	publicly perform, or publicly 	digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms 	on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of a recipient of the Work 	to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License.</li>
				<li>Adult Teaching Messages and Adult Message Series cannot be edited and must be 	played in their entirety.</li>
				<li>You may not sublicense the Work. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly 	perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that 	control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License 	Agreement.</li>
				<li>You agree to maintain a high level of integrity, quality and Biblical consistency in the 	programs in which You use the Work.  </li>
				<li>You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any 	manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or 	monetary compensation.

				<li>If You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or (ii) if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g. a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of 	such party or parties; the title of the Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier (“URI”), if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, 	unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and, consistent with Section 3(b) in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Derivative Work or Collective Work appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of 	the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.</li>
				<li>Except as specifically provided for in this License Agreement, You may not use the 	trademark or service marks of NewSpring Community Church, specifically including but 	not limited to representing your organization as NewSpring Community Church or 	affiliated with NewSpring Community Church.  Nothing herein shall be construed to 	place the parties in a partnership or joint venture together, and you shall not have the 	power to bind or obligate NewSpring Community Church in any manner. </li>
				<li>For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition: 	
					<ol>
						<li>Performance Royalties under Blanket Licenses. In addition to automatically 			terminating this License as provided in Section 7 below, Licensor reserves the 			exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance rights society 		(e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public performance or public 			digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work IF THAT PERFORMANCE IS 			PRIMARILY INTENDED FOR OR DIRECTED TOWARD COMMERCIAL 			ADVANTAGE OR PRIVATE MONETARY COMPENSATION. </li>
						<li>Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. In addition to automatically 	terminating this License as provided in Section 7 below, Licensor reserves the 	exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a music rights agency or 	designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You 	create from the Work ("cover version") and distribute, subject to the compulsory 	license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent 	in other jurisdictions), IF YOUR DISTRIBUTION OF SUCH COVER 	VERSION IS PRIMARILY INTENDED FOR OR DIRECTED TOWARD 	COMMERCIAL ADVANTAGE OR PRIVATE MONETARY 	COMPENSATION. </li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a sound recording, in addition to automatically terminating this License as provided in Section 7 below, Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions), IF YOUR PUBLIC DIGITAL PERFORMANCE IS PRIMARILY INTENDED FOR OR DIRECTED TOWARD COMMERCIAL ADVANTAGE OR PRIVATE MONETARY COMPENSATION. </li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer.</strong>  UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 
		<li><strong>Limitation on Liability. </strong>EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</li>
		<li><strong>Right to License</strong>
			<ol>
				<li>You acknowledge that the Work is valuable property owned exclusively by 	Licensor.  You agree that you will not challenge or dispute Licensor’s exclusive rights in 	and to the Work.</li>
				<li>Licensor represents that, to the best of its knowledge, it has the right to license the 	Work for the uses set forth in this Agreement.</li>
				<li>You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless NewSpring Community Church 	and its subsidiaries, officers, directors, employees, members, and agents against any 	claim, dispute, loss, expenses, damages, or other liability arising in whole or in part from 	Your breach of this Agreement or use of the Work.</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Termination</strong> 
			<ol>
				<li>This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any 	breach by You of the terms of this License. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any 	termination of this License.  Licensor reserves the right to terminate this License at any 	time. 
				<li>Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright or trademark in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to change the terms and conditions of this License at any time by posting an updated version of the Agreement on the NewSpring Community Church Web site located at http://newspring.cc/resources/.  You are responsible for regularly reviewing the NewSpring Community Church website for changes to this 	License.  Continued use of the Work after any such changes shall constitute your consent 	to such changes.  For your convenience and future reference, the date of the version of 	this License is set forth below.  Contained within the content file you will download is a copy of the version of the License that you reviewed and approved.  You can compare it to the version in effect at a later date to determine what changes, if any, have been made. </li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Miscellaneous </strong>
			<ol>
				<li>Enforceability: If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under 	applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the 	terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such 	provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision 	valid and enforceable. </li>
				<li>Waiver: No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach 	consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to 	be charged with such waiver or consent. </li>
				<li>Entire Agreement: This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties 	with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or 	representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound 	by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This 	License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and 	You.  This License shall be interpreted under the laws of the State of North Carolina.   </li>
				<li>Dispute Resolution: In keeping with 1 Corinthians 6:1-8, all disputes which may 	arise between You and the Church itself, or between You and any Pastor, Director, 	officer, employee, volunteer, agent, or other member of this Church, shall be resolved by 	mediation, and if not resolved by mediation, then by binding arbitration under the 	procedures and supervision of the Rules of Procedure for Christian Conciliation, 	Institute for Christian Conciliation, or similar faith-based mediation and arbitration 	group.  In the event that the Institute for Christian Conciliation ceases to exist during the 	course of this Agreement, arbitration under this section shall be conducted according to 	the rules of the American Arbitration Association.  Judgment upon an arbitration award 	may be entered in any court otherwise having jurisdiction.  The parties each agree to bear 	their own costs related to any mediation or arbitration proceeding including payment of 	their own attorneys’ fees.  Either party may file a motion seeking temporary injunctive 	relief from a court of competent jurisdiction in order to maintain the status quo until the 	underlying dispute or claim can be submitted for mediation or arbitration.<br>
				If a dispute may result in an award of monetary damages that could be paid under 	a 	Church insurance policy, then use of the conciliation, mediation, and arbitration 	procedure is conditioned on acceptance of the procedure by the liability insurer of the 	Church and the insurer’s agreement to honor any mediation, conciliation or arbitration award up to any applicable policy limits.  The mediation, conciliation, and arbitration 	process is not a substitute for any disciplinary process set forth in the Bylaws of the Church, and shall in no way affect the authority of the church to investigate reports of misconduct, to conduct hearings, or to administer discipline of members.</li>
